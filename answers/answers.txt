  * What is the name of the pokemon with id 45?
    2. SELECT name FROM pokemon.pokemons WHERE id=45;
  * How many pokemon are there?
    3. SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM pokemon.pokemons;
  * How many types are there?
    4. SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM pokemon.types;
  * How many pokemon have a secondary type?
    5. SELECT * FROM pokemon.pokemons where secondary_Type IS NOT NULL;


  ### Part 3: Joins and Groups
  Directions: Write a sql query or sql queries that can answer the following questions
  * What is each pokemon's primary type?
    1. SELECT p.name, t.name FROM pokemons p INNER JOIN types t ON p.primary_type = t.id;
  * What is Rufflet's secondary type?
    2. SELECT p.name,p.secondary_type,t.name FROM pokemons p JOIN types t ON p.secondary_type = t.id where p.name='Rufflet';
  * What are the names of the pokemon that belong to the trainer with trainerID 303?
    3. SELECT t.name, t.id FROM pokemons t INNER JOIN pokemon_trainer a ON t.id = a.pokemon_id WHERE a.trainerID = 303;
  * How many pokemon have a secondary type `Poison`
    4. SELECT COUNT(*) as "count" FROM pokemons WHERE primary_type = 7
  * What are all the primary types and how many pokemon have that type?
    5. SELECT c.primary_type, COUNT(t.id) as COUNT  FROM pokemons c LEFT JOIN types t ON c.primary_type = t.id GROUP BY c.primary_type;
  * How many pokemon at level 100 does each trainer with at least one level 100 pokemone have? (Hint: your query should not display a trainer
    6.  SELECT COUNT(pokemon_id) as "count" FROM pokemon_trainer WHERE pokeLevel = 100 GROUP BY trainerID;
  * How many pokemon only belong to one trainer and no other?
    7. SELECT

  ### Part 4: Final Report

  Directions: Write a query that returns the following collumns:

  | Pokemon Name | Trainer Name | Level | Primary Type | Secondary Type |
  |:------------:|:------------:|:-----:|:------------:|:--------------:|
  | Pokemon's name| Trainer's name| Current Level| Primary Type Name| Secondary Type Name|

  Sort the data by finding out which trainer has the strongest pokemon so that this will act as a ranking of strongest to weakest trainer. You may interpret strongest in whatever way you want, but you will have to explain your decision.
